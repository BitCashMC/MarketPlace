# MarketPlace

Marketplace is my first java application that incorporates in-depth aspects of front-end and back-end programming. It is a general app that will eventually serve many purposes. The project derives its name from the fact that once I am advanced enough, the project will be re-purposed to serve as a marketplace that emulates sites like Amazon.
